Warning detected by hpeesofsim in topology check during circuit set up.
    Number of nodes with only one device attached (topology corrected): 1


SP SP1[1] <LNA_lib:cell_1:schematic>   freq=(9.5 GHz->10.5 GHz)
Warning detected by hpeesofsim during SP analysis `SP1'.
    The simulation temperature (25.0 C) is not the same as the IEEE standard
    noise temperature (290 K or 16.85 C) in the noise analysis `SP1'.
    If the simulation temperature is not equal to the IEEE standard temperature,
    then the loss and the noise figure will not agree for a passive circuit.
    The `Temp' parameter on the Options item can be set to 16.85 C to
    eliminate this warning message.

Warning detected by hpeesofsim during SP analysis `SP1'.
    While evaluating `SNP1.CMP1.NFmin':
        The provided data file doesn't cover the requested value(s) of `freq'. Therefore the required data was obtained from extrapolation.
